This paper presents a novel 3D partial shape retrieval algorithm based on time-series analysis. Given a piece of a 3D shape, the proposed method encodes the shape descriptor given by the Heat Kernel Signature (HKS) as a time-series, where the time is considered an ordered sequence of vertices provided by the Fiedler vector. Finally, a similarity metric is created using a well-known tool in time-series analysis called Cross Recurrence Plot (CRP). The good performance of our method is also attested in a large collection of shape models.
